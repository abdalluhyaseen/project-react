          The School Management System is an innovative vision designed to
          transform traditional school operations into a fully integrated
          digital experience that enhances efficiency and organization. The idea
          of creating this system emerged in response to the challenges
          educational institutions face in managing daily tasks such as student
          registration, attendance tracking, scheduling, and establishing
          effective communication channels between schools and parents. The
          primary goal of developing this application is to simplify
          administrative and academic processes, allowing teachers and
          administrators to focus more on improving the quality of education.
          Additionally, the system helps promote transparency and provides
          accurate reports that support decision-making, making it an essential
          tool for building a sustainable and advanced educational environment.
